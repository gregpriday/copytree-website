					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						CopyTree is an open-source developer tool created by Greg Priday. This privacy policy
						applies to the CopyTree website (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and explains how we handle
						information. As a small open-source project, we prioritize privacy and collect minimal
						data.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Important:</strong> The CopyTree CLI tool itself runs entirely on your local machine
						and does not collect, store, or transmit any of your code or personal data. This policy only
						covers the marketing website you&rsquo;re currently viewing.
					</p>

					<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
					<p>
						We collect very limited, anonymized information to understand how people use our
						website:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We may use Google Analytics to collect anonymized usage
							statistics such as page views, session duration, device type, browser information, and
							general location (country-level only). IP addresses are anonymized and we do not collect
							personally identifiable information.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Cookies:</strong> We only use essential cookies for basic website functionality
							(such as remembering your theme preference). If Google Analytics is enabled, it may place
							analytics cookies which you can disable through your browser settings.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not have user accounts, contact forms, email signups,
							or any way to collect personal information like names, emails, or addresses.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
					<p>Any data we collect is used solely to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand which pages and features are most useful to visitors</li>
						<li>Improve the website&rsquo;s content and user experience</li>
						<li>Monitor and maintain website performance</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We do not use data for advertising, marketing campaigns, user profiling, or any
						commercial purposes beyond basic website improvement.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
					<p>
						We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise distribute any information with third parties,
						except:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Anonymous analytics data processed by Google Analytics under their privacy policy
						</li>
						<li>If required by law or to protect our legal rights</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
					<p>
						Since we collect no personal information, there&rsquo;s little data to manage. However,
						you can:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Block Analytics:</strong> Disable cookies in your browser settings or use privacy
							extensions like uBlock Origin to block Google Analytics
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Opt-out of Google Analytics:</strong> Use Google&rsquo;s opt-out browser addon
							at
							<a
								href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
								target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer"
							>
								tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
							</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Do Not Track:</strong> We respect browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Data Security</h2>
					<p>
						This website is hosted on secure infrastructure with standard security protections.
						Since we collect no sensitive personal data, security risks are minimal. The open-source
						nature of our project means our practices are transparent and auditable.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
					<p>
						This website is not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly
						collect any information from children.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>International Users</h2>
					<p>
						This website can be accessed globally. We comply with GDPR for EU users and similar
						privacy regulations by collecting minimal data and providing clear opt-out mechanisms.
						Since no personal data is processed, compliance requirements are minimal.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
					<p>
						We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the
						revised policy on this page with a new effective date. Your continued use of the website
						after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
